## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I want to explore more of HTML and CSS, perhaps trying more of the semantic HTML5 tags, learning about CSS grids and flexboxes, as well as study how I can make websites like these interactive through JavaScript and other languages.
